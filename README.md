# Hm?
This is fun project simulaing an old-school OS-like interface. 
Project was started with purpose of learning a bit about [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and then grew up to something a bit more bigger :D



## Getting Started

First, insure you have installed NodeJS & NPM. Latest versions would do just fine.

## Run
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can fork me or suggest changes or improvements via merge request.

## Technologies stack I am using here

To make this project possible I have been using following:

- NextJS - for programming
- Tailwind - for styling
- Freepick - for showing to you amazing retro icons
- Vercel - to host all above in cozy & relyable place

## Deploy on Vercel
